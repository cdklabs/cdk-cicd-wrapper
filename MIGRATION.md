# Migration Guide for CDK CI/CD Wrapper

This document outlines the notable migration and cleanup tasks involved in upgrading this CDK CI/CD Wrapper project to different versions.

## Version Compatibility

Each section details the changes introduced between specific version ranges (e.g., [0.0.0] - [0.0.6]).

### [0.0.12] - [0.1.0] Migration - Updates for Multiple Languages and Hooks

This upgrade brings exciting new features like support for Python, Java, Go, and C# in your CDK CI/CD projects! Additionally, there are some changes to how hooks are defined.

#### Breaking changes:

* **Property Renaming:** The type property on the IVpcConfig object has been renamed to vpcType. Make sure to update your code accordingly to avoid errors.

* **Hook Specification Update:** Previously, the provide function in IStackProvider returned a DeploymentHookConfig object. Now, it returns void instead. To add hooks, use the new Hook.addPreHook(Step) and Hook.addPostHook(Step) functions.

#### Here's how to update your code:

* **Fix IVpcConfig property:**

Find all instances of IVpcConfig.type and rename them to IVpcConfig.vpcType.

* **Update Hook Definition:**

If you were using the provide function to return a DeploymentHookConfig object for hooks, remove that functionality.
Instead, use the new Hook.addPreHook(Step) and Hook.addPostHook(Step) functions to define pre- and post-deployment hooks as needed.

```TypeScript
PipelineBlueprint.builder()
  .workbench({
    // ... your workbench definition
  })
  .definePhase(PipelinePhases.POST_DEPLOY, [
    new ShellCommandPhaseCommand('ls -l'), // Example command execution
  ])
  .addStack({
    provide(context) {
        // ... your main stack definition 

        return {
          pre: [yourPreHook],
          post: [yourPostHook],
        }
    },
  })
  .synth(app);
```

to

```TypeScript
PipelineBlueprint.builder()
  .workbench({
    // ... your workbench definition
  })
  .definePhase(PipelinePhases.POST_DEPLOY, [
    new ShellCommandPhaseCommand('ls -l'), // Example command execution
  ])
  .addStack({
    provide(context) {
        // ... your main stack definition 

        Hook.addPreHook(yourPreHook);
        Hook.addPostHook(yourPostHook);
    },
  })
  .synth(app);
```

## [0.0.0] - [0.0.6] Migration

### Changes:

**Stack Renaming**: The stack name LogRetentionRoleStack has been renamed to PostDeployExecutorStack.
**Default Inclusion**: By default, PostDeployExecutorStack is no longer automatically included in all deployment stages.

### Actions Required:

**Stack Removal**: Remove any existing LogRetentionRoleStack deployments from your AWS accounts.
**Manual Inclusion**: Explicitly include the PostDeployExecutorStack in the stages where its functionality is required.
Example Usage (Post-Deployment Actions):

```TypeScript
PipelineBlueprint.builder()
  .workbench({
    // ... your workbench definition
  })
  .definePhase(PipelinePhases.POST_DEPLOY, [
    new ShellCommandPhaseCommand('ls -l'), // Example command execution
  ])
  .addStack({
    provide(context) {
        // ... your main stack definition 

        new PostDeployExecutorStack(context.scope, 'post-deploy-execution', {
            resAccount: context.blueprintProps.deploymentDefinition.RES.env.account,
            stageName: context.stage,
            name: context.blueprintProps.applicationName,
        });
    },
  })
  .synth(app);
```
