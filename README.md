# Welcome to the CI/CD Wrapper

The CI/CD Wrapper gives you an easy way to deliver your CDK applications like a PRO.
This repository contain all the construct provided and used to build, test and deliver the CDK Applications through multiple stages, and AWS accounts to have high level of controlle over your Software Delivery pipelines.

The documentation for the {{ project_name }} Core is stored under the docs/ (index file: index.md) and is designed to be viewed as an MkDocs html site. Before heading to the documentation we highly recommend you:

- Run the build docs script `./scripts/build-docs` using you UNIX cli
- Start the local mkdocs webserver to view locally the ConfigBuilder documentation site with the `mkdocs serve` command; the documentation will then be available at https://localhost:8000

## Intended usage

You should not fork this repository and expect to reproduce the same in your AWS Accounts, this repository is only used for preparing, testing and shipping all the packages used by the {{ project_name }}. Using the {{ project_name }} Core brings you the following benefits:

- :white_check_mark: Automated Open Source License checking (we have provided a list of licenses which you don't want to have them present in your PRODUCTION workloads)
- :white_check_mark: Pre/Post deploy hooks during the deployment in each of the stages (DEV/INT/PROD)
  - :white_check_mark: PRE -> Unit Tests
  - :white_check_mark: POST -> Functional Tests, Load Testing
- :white_check_mark: Flexible definition of stages, the default (DEV/INT/PROD) stages can be extended with new custom stages like EXP.
- :white_check_mark: Stacks deployment can be specified for each stages separately
- :white_check_mark: Customizable CI steps to meet project requirements
- :white_check_mark: Centrally store compliance logs in S3 Buckets which are pre-configured on a per-stage/environment basis
- :white_check_mark: Build Lambda Layers for Python and scan dependencies in the CI/CD (in case of CVE findings, block the pipeline)

## Debugging

\_\_Fill_what_is_missing_by_explaining here the debugging of the packages after the installation

## Use cases

The {{ project_name }} Core is the next step on road to standardize and simplify the multi-stage CI/CD process that the successful {{ project_name }} started. Thus the use cases for the {{ project_name }} Core are the same as for the {{ project_name }}.

- Multi staged CI/CD pipeline for IaaC projects

On top of that the {{ project_name }} Core has arbitrary scripts that can be leveraged in any projects involving TypeScript, NPM, and/or Python.
