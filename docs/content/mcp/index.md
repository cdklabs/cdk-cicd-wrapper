# MCP Tools

The CDK CI/CD Wrapper provides specialized **[MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) Tools** that integrate seamlessly with AI-powered development assistants to help diagnose, troubleshoot, and optimize your CDK CI/CD Wrapper applications.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely access external tools and data sources. MCP servers provide specialized capabilities that can be accessed by any MCP-compatible client, including popular AI coding assistants.

## Available MCP Tools

### Debugger Server

## Compatible MCP Clients

The MCP tools work with any [MCP-compatible client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients), including:

- **[Amazon Q CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line.html)** - Amazon's AI-powered command-line assistant
- **[Cline](https://cline.bot/)** - The Collaborative AI Coder for VS Code
- **Any other [MCP-compatible client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients)** - Following the standard MCP protocol

## Getting Started

To get started with MCP tools:

1. **Choose an MCP Client** - Install one of the compatible clients (we recommend Cline for VS Code)
2. **Configure the MCP Server** - Set up the connection to the CDK CI/CD Wrapper MCP server
3. **Start Debugging** - Ask your AI assistant to analyze your CDK CI/CD Wrapper project

Example usage with any MCP-compatible AI assistant:

```
"Can you use the cdk-cicd-wrapper-debugger to check my project configuration?"
```

The AI assistant will automatically connect to the MCP server and provide comprehensive analysis and recommendations.
